# Tasks

The requirements for each task will be detailed here.  Please time track using Clockify.

After each task is complete, raise a new pull request against master, and in the description of the pull request provide details of what the approach was, and include details on what areas of testing you have done.  Videos and images can be pasted into the pull request description which may help you with explaining what has been done.  This will save me a significant amount of time and allow me to help you on development when I can, rather than reviewing all of the time.
