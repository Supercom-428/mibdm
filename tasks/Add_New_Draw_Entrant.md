# Add New Draw Entrant
We need to have a form that allows us to create a new draw entrant.  This should populate all of the fields in the draw entrant table, with company id being optional.

We also need the ability to edit a draw entrant, which we should link to from the master view page, perhaps by clicking on their name.  This will allow them to update the flags on some of the fields.

Importantly, this form should also ask the question of how many entries to create for this entrant.  On save, it should create the entrant, create the amount of entries requested, and display on the success page the details of the draw entries so the user has the numbers to pass on to the entrant.

Perhaps the "success page" is actually the edit page, which should show a list of that entrant's draw entries in a read only list.
